## [Calculating moon phases quickly and reasonably accurately](https://github.com/deirdreobyrne/LunarPhase/)

There seems to be a proliferation of poor algorithms for calculating the phase of the moon. This article presents an algorithm which is fast to calculate and is
reasonably accurate. The algorithm is derived from work done by Jean Meeus in his 1991 book _Astronomical Algorithms_.
